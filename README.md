This repository helps me experiment with the DDD approach.

## Description
All implementations are inspired by books, [ValueObject](https://github.com/andrzejkupczyk/valueobjects) library created by [Nicol√≤ Pignatelli](https://github.com/nicolopignatelli), 
[SeedStack](http://seedstack.org) Java development stack, [ValueObjects toolkit](https://github.com/barryosull/valueobjects)
 and some other, more direct sources, but mainly by my experiences and needs.
